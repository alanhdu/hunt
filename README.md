Hunt
==========
Trying to implement the hunt terminal game online.

Plan to use Python backend and coffee/javascript frontend.
Flask and Socket-IO to connect them (maybe we should
use Node.js?)

# Run Instructions
python server.py

# Prereqs:
 * Python 2.7
     * numpy          -- Arrays for fast & easy arena implementation
     * flask          -- Lightweight web framework      
     * flask-socketIO -- Bridge between flask and Socket-IO 
 * Coffeescript
 * Javascript
     * Bootstrap -- Easy site layout. Work on frontend later
     * JQuery    -- Required by bootstrap
     * Socket-IO -- Continued communication w/ server
