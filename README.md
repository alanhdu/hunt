Hunt
==========
Trying to implement the hunt terminal game online.

Plan to use Python backend and coffeee/javascript frontend.
Flask and Socket-IO to connect them (maybe we should
use Node.js?)

Prereqs:
    * Python 2.7
        * numpy         Arrays for fast & easy arena implementation
        * flask         Lightweight web framework      
        * flask-sockets Bridge between flask and Socket-IO 
    * Coffeescript
    * Javascript
        * Bootstrap     Easy site layout. Work on frontend later
        * JQuery        Required by bootstrap
        * Socket-IO     Continued communication w/ server
